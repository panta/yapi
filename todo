  - bundle all the shit and run it.

```yapi
yapi: v1
url: https://myurl.com/foo/endpoint
method: POST

expect:
  status: 200
  assert: -
    - .field == 'foo'


post_script: |
  import _ from 'lodash';
  import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid';

  // 'response' is injected by yapi
  const names = _.map(response.body.users, 'name');
  yapi.vars.set('trace_id', uuid());

```
