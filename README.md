**The API client that lives in your terminal (and your git repo).**

Stop clicking through heavy Electron apps just to send a JSON body. **yapi** is a CLI-first, offline-first, git-friendly API client for HTTP, gRPC, and TCP. It uses simple YAML files to define requests, meaning you can commit them, review them, and run them anywhere.

### Alternative Installation Methods

**Using Homebrew (macOS):**

```bash

```

**Using Go:**

```bash
go install yapi.run/cli/cmd/yapi@latest
```

**From Source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamierpond/yapi
cd yapi
make install
```

-----

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Create a request file** (e.g., `get-user.yapi.yml`):

    ```yaml
    yapi: v1
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
    method: GET
    ```

2.  **Run it:**

    ```bash
    yapi run get-user.yapi.yml
    ```

3.  **See the magic:** You get a beautifully highlighted, formatted response.

> **Note:** The `yapi: v1` version tag is required at the top of all config files. This enables future schema evolution while maintaining backwards compatibility.

-----

## 📚 Examples

**yapi** speaks many protocols. Here is how you define them.

### 1\. HTTP with JSON Body

No more escaping quotes in curl.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://api.example.com/posts
method: POST
content_type: application/json

# yapi handles the JSON encoding for you
body:
  title: "Hello World"
  tags:
    - cli
    - testing
  author:
    id: 123
    active: true
```

### 2\. Environment Variables & Chaining

Use shell environment variables directly. Perfect for CI/CD or keeping secrets out of git.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://api.example.com/secure-data
method: GET

headers:
  Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}
  X-Request-ID: ${REQUEST_ID:-default_id}
```

### 3\. Request Chaining

Chain multiple requests together, referencing data from previous steps. Build authentication flows, integration tests, or multi-step workflows.

```yaml
yapi: v1
chain:
  - name: get_todo
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
    method: GET
    expect:
      status: 200
      assert:
        - .userId != null
        - .id == 1

  - name: get_user
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${get_todo.userId}
    method: GET
    expect:
      status: 200
      assert:
        - .name != null
```

**Key features:**
- Reference previous step data with `${step_name.field}` syntax
- Access nested JSON properties: `${login.data.token}`
- Assertions use JQ expressions that must evaluate to true
- Chains stop on first failure (fail-fast)

### 4\. Assertions & Expectations

Validate responses inline with JQ-powered assertions. No separate test framework needed.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://api.example.com/users
method: GET
expect:
  status: 200              # or [200, 201] for multiple valid codes
  assert:
    - . | length > 0       # array has items
    - .[0].email != null   # first item has email
    - .[] | .active == true # all items are active
```

### 5\. JQ Filtering (Built-in\!)

Don't grep output. Filter it right in the config.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
method: GET

# Only show me names and emails, sorted by name
jq_filter: "[.[] | {name, email}] | sort_by(.name)"
```

### 6\. gRPC (Reflection Support)

Stop hunting for `.proto` files. If your server supports reflection, **yapi** just works.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: grpc://localhost:50051
service: helloworld.Greeter
rpc: SayHello

body:
  name: "yapi User"
```

### 7\. GraphQL

First-class support for queries and variables.

```yaml
yapi: v1
url: https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql

graphql: |
  query getCountry($code: ID!) {
    country(code: $code) {
      name
      capital
    }
  }

variables:
  code: "BR"
```

-----

## 🎛️ Interactive Mode (TUI)

Don't remember the file name? Just run `yapi` without arguments.

```bash
yapi
```

This launches the **Interactive TUI**. You can fuzzy-search through all your `.yapi.yml` files in the current directory (and subdirectories) and execute them instantly.

### Shell History Integration

For a richer CLI experience, source the yapi shell helper in your `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc
YAPI_ZSH="/path/to/yapi/bin/yapi.zsh"  # or wherever you installed yapi
[ -f "$YAPI_ZSH" ] && source "$YAPI_ZSH"

# Optional: short alias
alias a="yapi"
```

This enables:
- **TUI commands in shell history**: When you use the interactive TUI to select a file, the equivalent CLI command is added to your shell history. Press `↑` to re-run it instantly.
- **Seamless workflow**: Select interactively once, then repeat with up-arrow forever.

> **Note:** Requires `jq` to be installed.

### 👀 Watch Mode

Tired of `Alt-Tab` -\> `Up Arrow` -\> `Enter`? Use watch mode to re-run the request every time you save the file.

```bash
yapi watch ./my-request.yapi.yml
```

-----

## 🧠 Editor Integration (LSP)

Unlike other API clients, **yapi** ships with a **full LSP implementation** out of the box. No extensions to install, no separate tools to configure. Your editor becomes an intelligent API development environment.

```bash
yapi lsp
```

### What You Get

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-time Validation** | Errors and warnings as you type, with precise line/column positions. Catches issues before you hit run. |
| **Intelligent Autocompletion** | Context-aware suggestions for keys, HTTP methods, content types, and more. |
| **Hover Info** | Hover over `${VAR}` to see environment variable status and (redacted) values. |
| **Go to Definition** | Jump to referenced chain steps and variables. |

### Neovim (Native Plugin)

**yapi** was built with Neovim in mind. First-class support via `lua/yapi_nvim`:

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
  dir = "~/path/to/yapi/lua/yapi_nvim",
  config = function()
    require("yapi_nvim").setup({
      lsp = true,    -- Enables the yapi Language Server
      pretty = true, -- Uses the TUI renderer in the popup
    })
  end
}
```

Commands:
- `:YapiRun` - Execute the current buffer
- `:YapiWatch` - Open a split with live reload

### VS Code / Any LSP-Compatible Editor

The LSP communicates over stdio and works with any editor that supports the Language Server Protocol. Point your editor's LSP client to `yapi lsp` and you're set.
